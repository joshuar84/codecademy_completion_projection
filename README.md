# Codecademy Completion Projection

#### This is a personal project I've made to help track my progress on Codecademy.
#### It takes a percent value and based off of the start date it projects when you
#### will finish in the future. I think it might benefit others. This is just a simple
#### web page that loads onto your local computer and it's linked to a JavaScript and 
#### CSS file. It uses local storage to save your progress. You can change the files
#### to fit your needs.

## Technologies
